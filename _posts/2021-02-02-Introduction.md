Hi, I'm Catherene Baker. Thanks for visiting my blog. I hope to share with you the many things that permeate my inquisitive mind. Sometimes, a blog post may be on all the questions that arise as I work through solving a problem, and sometimes, I may give you a clear walkthrough of how I found the answer to a question that's been pestering my psyche. I don't have all the answers to lifes mysteries but I do have the ability to find them.

Some of the topics I plan on covering involve an open mind. Join me in exploring them together.
